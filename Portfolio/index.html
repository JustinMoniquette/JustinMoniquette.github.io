              I'm a storyteller and graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology who can develop a website as well as an intriguing plot. Currently an online instructor, I teach the next generation of game developers, writers and web designers all the tools needed to bring their ideas to life.

            <p>
              When I'm not teaching or coding you can find me playing my favorite games across all consoles, writing my next novel or using Twine to plan out my next game.

                <p>
                  The goal of this project was to inspire people to learn about different cultures through an easy and
                  fun experience that mimics a classic arcade game.
                </p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                  Much like an arcade claw machine, the game focuses on grabbing a capsule using the physical joystick
                  attached to the arcade cabinet to control the digital claw machine, where upon success the player
                  would recieve a ticket to a random location in the world with simple tasks to help the player
                  beginning learning about that locations culture.
                </p>
                <h2>My Contribution</h2>
                <p>
                  For this project I primarily worked on preparing and connecting the phsyical controls to the digital
                  on our arcade cabinet as well as coding the controls for the game. I also assisted in creating the UI
                  and coding the different game screens that appear through out the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>
                  Done within a sixteen week period there was a lot my team and I were able to accomplish to create a
                  satisfying and unique experience. With more time however, we would add more locations for people to
                  "visit" as well as add different arcade style games for the user to play and learn more about
                  different cultures.

              <h2>Goal</h2>
              <p>
                The goal of this game was to create a casual gaming experience with intuitive controls and mechanics.
                The idea for the
                project came from a brainstorm session with my other team members in which we decided to combine the
                simple mechanics of
                Plinko and Skee-Ball with touch controls.
              </p>
              <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>
                The game focuses heavily on using gravity to help control and navigate the falling snake with the goal
                of getting it
                into one of the point bins. Early on the only goal of the player is to navigate the snake into the
                highest point bin
                while also trying to collect coins to increase their score. As the player progresses to further levels
                new elements like
                cannons, bumpers, traps and the like are added to create added difficulty and complexity to the game.
              </p>
              <h2>My Contribution</h2>
              <p>
                For this project I was in charge of designing and developing the scoring system as well as the end of
                level UI that
                showed the player how they did on the level. I also assisted in creating several of the levels featured
                in the final
                deliverable of the game.
              </p>
              <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
              <p>
                Done within a four week time period we were not able to add everything we wanted. If given more time we
                planned to added
                a store where the player could spend coins to add cosmetics to their snake as well as refine the levels
                and menus.

              <h2>Goal</h2>
              <p>
                The goal of this job was to create a companion website to the game being developed alongside it while
                providing
                information on the game and characters in unique surreal ways that matches the tone of the game.
              </p>
              <h2>My Contribution</h2>
              <p>
                For this job I was tasked as the team lead for the web team which focused on the creation of the
                companion website. My
                duties included directing the other members of the team during the development of the website as well as
                develop the
                page for the mother character in the game.

              </p>
              <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
              <p>
                Only on the project for ten weeks, there was a lot I was not able to do because of time restrictions and
                lack of
                resources. Due to all the sites media coming from the art team there were many assets asked for that
                were not completed
                before my time on the project was finished. Because of this my contribution acts more as a starting off
                point or proof
                of concept instead of the finished product. If given more time, I would continue to polish the html of
                the page as well
                as include assets that better connect the image of the site to the game.
